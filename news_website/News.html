            <p class="card-text">NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on
                Thursday busted a major human trafficking network
                involved in sending Indian youths to Russia-Ukraine war
                zone on the pretext of lucrative jobs.
                According to officials, the CBI is conducting searches
                across Delhi, Trivandrum, Mumbai, Ambala, Chandigarh,
                Madurai and Chennai. The officials said the agency has
                registered an FIR against various visa consultancy firms
                and agents.
                The development comes a day after a 30-year-old man
                from Hyderabad, Mohammed Afsan, who had been
                allegedly duped into joining the Russian army, has been
                killed in the ongoing war with Ukraine.
                He is the second Indian to be killed in the conflict after a
                man from Gujarat, Hamil Mangukiya from Surat, was killed
                about a week ago. Mohammed Imran, Afsan’s brother,
                wrote back to the Moscow embassy on X, asking for proof
                of the death. Imran had told TOI recently that he was
                planning to go to Moscow to trace his brother and bring
                him home. Imran later told TOI that although he had
                received a call from the Moscow embassy confirming the
                death, the recruiting agent claimed his brother was alive
                and would get some proof latest by Tuesday.

            <h5 class="card-title">Bangalore Water Crisis Explained: What Led To Severe Shortage Of 
                Water And How City Plans To Tackle It
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Bangalore: The IT hub is facing a serious water problem, mainly because of a severe drought. 
                There hasn't been enough rain, which has caused the water levels in the Cauvery 
                River to drop. This shortage doesn't just affect drinking water but also impacts 
                irrigation. Additionally, borewells in Bengaluru are drying up because of the lack of 
                rain in recent months.The Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), which supplies drinking water to the tech hub, states that while the situation is manageable in central areas, it's very serious in the city's outskirts.
                To deal with the water shortage, the state government plans to use milk tankers 
                from Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) to deliver water to Bengaluru. They will also take 
                control of private borewells in and around the city. Deputy Chief Minister DK 
                Shivakumar discussed this during a meeting with various agencies including BBMP, 
                BWSSB, and the police. Owners of water tankers have until Thursday to register them 
                with the government, which will then take over all tankers in the city.
                People in Bengaluru are saying that water tanker operators are taking advantage of 
                the water shortage and charging very high prices. Previously, a 1000-liter water tanker 
                would cost between ₹600 to ₹800, but now it's more than ₹2000.

                Rameshwaram Cafe blast: How cameras in 
                Bengaluru buses are aiding in the probe</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Bangalore:
                The Rameshwaram Cafe blast suspect presumably ran a recce of the spot before the actual operation, 
                and took measures to avoid identification. He wore a cap, glasses and mask and paid for his Rava idli order at the cafe with cash.
                To be safe, he chose to travel by bus rather than a private vehicle on the day he carried out the blast. Only 
                that it wasn’t as foolproof as he’d imagined. He missed out on a tiny detail: Most Bengaluru Metropolitan 
                Transport Corporation (BMTC) buses have CCTV cameras.
                Latest footage of the accused – who travelled in a BMTC Volvo bus (KA-01 F4517), which normally plies on 
                the 500F route (Central Silk Board - Kadugodi) – has emerged. The visuals from March 1, the day he 
                executed the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blast in Rameshwaram Cafe that left 10 injured, offer a 
                clearer look at his face.

            <p class="card-text">
                Thiruvananthapuram:
                Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday launched 
                India's first state-owned OTT platform, CSpace in 
                Thiruvananthapuram. Speaking at the event, the Chief Minister 
                said the launch of state-run OTT will prove to be a decisive step in 
                the advancement of Malayalam Cinema, news agency ANI reported.

                "Several private OTT platforms give prominence to films in the 
                most widely spoken language since their prime motive is to 
                maximize profit. CSpace's priority will stream content with 
                artistic and cultural values. This platform is envisioned with the 
                multifaceted goal of preserving and promoting the Malayalam 
                language," ANI quoted the Chief Minister as saying.

                Hyderabad edging towards 
                drinking water crisis
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Hyderabad: After years of consistent water supply, particularly during 
                the summers, Hyderabad seems to be edging towards a drinking water crisis.

                With depleting levels in the reservoirs which are the principle water 
                source for the city and mediocre groundwater levels due to inadequate 
                rainwater harvesting, the upcoming months of summer are bound to be 
                challenging.
                Although few localities experienced water shortages in the past, the 
                overall supply in the city used to be sufficient. However, this time 
                around, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board 
                (HMWS&SB) seems to be less prepared, which is showcased in not just 
                the delayed water tanker deliveries, but also their increased bookings in the first place.

                Multiple residential colonies in Hyderabad, especially those in close 
                proximity to the IT corridor, are complaining about unreliable municipal 
                water supply and tanker delivery. In some areas, while there is a regular 
                water supply, the pressure is too low to fulfill their requirements.

                port off Gaza for aid delivery</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                President Joe Biden will announce Thursday that the US military 
                will set up a temporary port off Gaza, senior administration 
                officials said as reported by Associated Press. This action comes 
                amidst global efforts to create a sea route for food and other aid 
                as UN and U.S. officials warn of famine among Palestinian 
                civilians trapped by the Israel-Hamas war.
                The announcement signals further deepening U.S. involvement in 
                the war and the escalating tensions and fighting in the region. It 
                also shows the Biden administration resorting to an unusual 
                workaround to get help to Gaza's 2.3 million people, as it deals 
                with restrictions that U.S. ally Israel has placed on overland aid 
                deliveries, and with growing criticism of the administration's own 
                handling of the conflict.

                Taking on X, Taran Adarsh wrote, "Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐️ Drama. 
                Thrills. Chills. Shock-value. All enveloped in a near-perfect, 
                captivating plot… This is supernatural genre done right… 
                Unpredictable twists and turns are a big plus… Watch it!

                The written material gives ample scope to the principal cast to 
                spread their wings… #AjayDevgn excels as the helpless parent; 
                conveys fear, concern and vulnerability with precision… 
                #RMadhavan is outstanding; he is savage, vicious and sadistic, all 
                combined, without going overboard.
                
                It’s a delight to watch #Jyotika on the #Hindi screen after a really 
                long gap. She’s in super form… #JankiBodiwala gets to portray 
                the most difficult part in the film and she does a brilliant job.
                
                Director #VikasBahl charters into the supernatural territory for 
                the first time and the execution of the subject keeps you on 
                tenterhooks for most parts… Only thing, the post-interval 
                portions could’ve been sharper and tighter.
                
                Last but not the least, a special mention of the terrific 
                background score [#AmitTrivedi], it amplifies the tension and 
                unsettling vibe."
                
                Meanwhile, Nambiar, who earlier directed films such as "Shaitan", 
                "David" and "Taish", has also produced the movie along with 
                Prabhu Antony and Madhu Alexander.
                
                “First Time Watching a Debue Actress Overshadow Legendary 
                Actors in Every Scene . Kudos To @jankibodiwala 
                @ActorMadhavan as Antagonist Will Be Remembered For a Long 
                Time," wrote a user on X.

                  Himachal Pradesh news: Severe snowfall hits 
                  Lahaul-Spiti; electricity, communication down
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Heavy snowfall in Himachal Pradesh's Lahual and Spiti district 
                  threw normal life out of order as the communications networks, 
                  electricity, and water supply remained disrupted for days. The 
                  fresh tranche of snowfall started on March 2 and a white sheet of 
                  snow is covering the upper reaches of the hill station.

                  An official from the local administration spoke with news agency 
                  ANI through a satellite phone and revealed that the recent 
                  snowfall had disrupted the entire communication infrastructure 
                  in the region, leaving only satellite phones operational.
                  
                  The official said that the restoration of communication networks 
                  and water supply is contingent upon the restoration of power 
                  lines.
                  
                  While speaking about the blockage of infrastructure in Lahual 
                  and Spiti, the official said that numerous roadways, encompassing 
                  three national highways, have been shut down in the region due 
                  to the snowfall. Notably, the region experienced an avalanche at 
                  Tandi Bridge, resulting in the partial burial of shops in the vicinity.
                  
                  <b>Restoration work underway on a war footing</b>

                  The administration said that the restoration work for the 
                  communication and electricity lines is underway on a war footing. 
                  A SDRF official added that a total of 346 roads, including three 
                  national highways, are currently inaccessible. Additionally, 365 
                  electricity supply schemes have been adversely affected, and 
                  eight water supply schemes have been disrupted as a 
                  consequence of the snowfall.
                  
                  In the Lahaul-Spiti district, specifically, two national highways and 
                  260 roads are presently closed, and 155 electricity supply 
                  schemes in the area have encountered disruptions.

                  PM Modi takes a jibe at opposition in Siliguri: ‘TMC 
                  worried about nephews, Congress about ...’
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  During his visit to West Bengal's Siliguri, Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a 
                  range of infrastructure projects in the state worth more than ₹4,500 crore. He also 
                  took a jibe at the opposition parties and said that the TMC and the Congress are busy 
                  in supporting their nephews, sons and daughters. 

                  He also accused the TMC of looting the state for several years and said that it is the 
                  TMC government which is not letting the MNREGA money and other funds released for the 
                  state reach to the people.
                  
                  "Over the last 10 years, development of the state, especially its northern region, has 
                  been a priority for our government. We need 21st century infrastructure for the development 
                  of this area," he said. During his visit, PM launched several projects of railway line 
                  electrification in northern West Bengal.
